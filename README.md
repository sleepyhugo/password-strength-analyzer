# Password Strength Analyzer (Java)

This is a small Java project I built for fun to practice OOP and get more comfortable with Java. 
It analyzes a password and gives you a score from 0–100, a strength rating, and feedback on how to improve it. 
Everything runs in the console, and the output is color coded to make it look nicer.
